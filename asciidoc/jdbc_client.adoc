=== JDBC Client

The Vert.x JDBC Client remains available in Vert.x 4 and will remain supported for the lifetime
of Vert.x 4.

A new reactive SQL client has been designed for the past 2 years built on top of the experience we learned
from the Vert.x JDBC Client feedback from the community.

The new SQL client API has a few implementations:

- a reactive PostgreSQL client (formerly the Reactive PG Client)
- a reactive MySQL client
- a reactive DB2 client
- the current JDBC client (offering the former JDBC client API and the SQL client API)

The reactive implementations use the database network protocols and are resource-efficient, while the JDBC client uses worker threads to deal with the blocking nature of JDBC.

todo.
