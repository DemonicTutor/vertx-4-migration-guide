=== SockJS Handler

==== Event bus `writeHandler` is disabled by default

In Vert.x 4 `SockJSSocket` no longer registers a clustered event bus consumer by default.
In order to write to the socket over the event bus, you must now enable this behavior in `SockJSHandlerOptions`:

```java
Router router = Router.router(vertx);

SockJSHandlerOptions options = new SockJSHandlerOptions()
  .setRegisterWriteHandler(true); // enable the event bus consumer registration

SockJSHandler sockJSHandler = SockJSHandler.create(vertx, options);

router.mountSubRouter("/myapp", sockJSHandler.socketHandler(sockJSSocket -> {

  // Retrieve the writeHandlerID and store it (e.g. in a local map)
  String writeHandlerID = sockJSSocket.writeHandlerID();

}));
```

When enabled, the event bus consumer is now local only by default but this is configurable too:

```java
SockJSHandlerOptions options = new SockJSHandlerOptions()
  .setRegisterWriteHandler(true) // enable the event bus consumer registration
  .setLocalWriteHandler(false); // register a clustered event bus consumer
```
