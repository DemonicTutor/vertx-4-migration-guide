This section explains the changes in threads.

== Context affinity for non {VertX} thread

The `Vertx.getOrCreateContext()` method creates a single context for each non {VertX} thread. The non {VertX} threads are associated with a context the first time a context is created. In earlier releases, a new context was created each time the method was called from a non {VertX} thread.

----
new Thread(() -> {
  assertSame(vertx.getOrCreateContext(), vertx.getOrCreateContext());
}).start();
----

This change does not affect your applications, unless your application implicitly relies on a new context to be created with each invocation.

In the following example the n blocks run concurrently as each blocking code is called on a different context.
----
for (int i = 0;i < n;i++) {
  vertx.executeBlocking(block, handler);
}
----

To get the same results in {VertX} {v4}, you must update the code:
----
for (int i = 0;i < n;i++) {
  vertx.executeBlocking(block, false, handler);
}
----
