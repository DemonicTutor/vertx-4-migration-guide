= Support for Tracing

{VertX} {v4} supports distributed tracing, enabling the use of tracing
to monitor microservices and identify performance issues.

{VertX} {v4} integrates with https://opentracing.io[Opentracing] and https://zipkin.io[Zipkin]
solutions.

The following {VertX} components can log traces:

- HTTP server and HTTP client
- {VertX} SQL client
- {VertX} Kafka client

More components will be integrated later.
