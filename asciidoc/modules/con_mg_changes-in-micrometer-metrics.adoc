= Changes in Micrometer metrics

The following section describes the changes in Micrometer metrics.

== TCP sent and received bytes are recorded as counters with equivalent HTTP request and response summaries

In prior releases, the following metrics were recorded as distribution summaries for sockets. From {VertX} {4} onward, these metrics are logged as counter, which report the amount of data exchanged.

* Net client
+
** `vertx_net_client_bytes_read`
** `vertx_net_client_bytes_written`

* Net server
+
** `vertx_net_server_bytes_read`
** `vertx_net_server_bytes_written`

For these counters, equivalent distribution summaries have been introduced for HTTP. These summaries are used to collect information about the request and response sizes.

* HTTP client
+
** `vertx_http_client_request_bytes`
** `vertx_http_client_response_bytes`

* HTTP server
+
** `vertx_http_server_request_bytes`
** `vertx_http_server_response_bytes`

== Renamed the metrics

The following metrics have been renamed.
