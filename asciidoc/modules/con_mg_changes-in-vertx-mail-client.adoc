= Changes in {VertX} mail client

The following section describes the changes in {VertX} mail client.

== `MailAttachment` is available as an interface

From {VertX} {4} onwards, `MailAttachment` is available as an interface. It enables you to use the mail attachment functionality in a stream. In earlier releases of {VertX}, `MailAttachment` was available as a class and attachment for mails was represented as a data object.

== Mail configuration interface extends the net client options

`MailConfig` interface extends the `NetClientOptions` interface. Due to this extension, mail configuration also supports the proxy setting of the `NetClient`XXX.
