=== Apache Ignite Cluster Manager

The Vert.x Ignite cluster manager has been rewritten to support the new Clustering SPI in Vert.x 4. This should not have any notable difference for the developer.

The second change was about the configuration. The reason for doing so was to reduce the transient dependencies introduced by the `ignite-spring` extension which was used to parse XML configurations.
This change removes more than 10MB of assets from your dependencies.

If you are using the cluster manager without any configuration changes there is no migration required but if you were using a custom `ignite.xml` you can either switch to the new `ignite.json` format or add `ignite-spring` back to you classpath.
